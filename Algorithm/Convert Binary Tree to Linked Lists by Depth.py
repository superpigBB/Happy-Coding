# Description
# Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list
# of all the nodes at each depth (e.g., if you have a tree with depth D, you'll have D linked lists).

# Have you met this question in a real interview?
# Example
# Given binary tree:
#
#     1
#    / \
#   2   3
#  /
# 4
# return
#
# [
#   1->null,
#   2->3->null,
#   4->null
# ]
